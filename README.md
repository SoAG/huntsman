# Huntsman

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/missinglink/huntsman.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/missinglink/huntsman)

## A super simple web spider

Huntsman takes one or more 'seed' urls with the `spider.queue.add()` method.

Once the process is kicked off with `spider.start()`, it will take care of extracting links from the page and following only the pages we want.

To define which pages are crawled and extract data, use `spider.on()` with a string or regular expression.

Each page will only be crawled once. If muliple regular expressions match the uri, they will all be called.

**Page URLs which do not match an `on` condition will never be crawled**

### Install

```bash
npm install huntsman --save
```

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/huntsman.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/huntsman/)

### Example

```javascript
var huntsman = require('../index');
var spider = huntsman.spider();

spider.extensions = [
  huntsman.extension( 'stats' ),
  huntsman.extension( 'recurse' ),
  huntsman.extension( 'cheerio' )
];

spider.on( /http:\/\/en\.wikipedia\.org\/wiki\/\w+:\w+$/, function ( err, res, body, $ ){
  console.log({
    uri: res.uri,
    heading: $('h1.firstHeading').text().trim(),
    body: $('div#mw-content-text p').text().trim()
  });
});

spider.queue.add( 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page' );
spider.start();
```

```bash
peter@edgy:/tmp$ node example.js 
{
  "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Recent_additions",
